Mighty mountains, I dreaded its peaks and curves,
the indomitable spirit inside, settled my nerves.
So I climbed and climbed to the top,
left my past behind, I did not stop.

First came the rain, making my feet wet,
then came the sun, making my brow sweat.
I crossed a line, made the trees jealous,
Pain in my body, but I couldn't care less.

Choosing the wrong step could be as fatal,
as a life, with no adventure to tell.
My mind must make that crucial decision,
which stone next, in this expedition.

I saw my yellow tent by the riverside,
a valley like a silver necklace on a bride.
Stretched my shape, and washed my face,
with water so cold, that set my wits ablaze. 

Twilight flirted with day and night,
Sky blushed as it turned orange, bright.
Adios, I am done for the day, said the setting Sun.
'See you on the other side' was Earth's cunning pun.

The river carried mountain's letter to the sea.
The poem rhymed words of passionate love to me.
Fate, they cannot unite; divided by an invisible wall.
Faith! the mountain awaited the next rainfall.

# The painting
I looked up, now the canvas was painted black,
A full moon and a thousand splendid suns smiled back.
I walked in the dark, forlorn, for long
Mighty mountains, I loved its peaks and curves.
