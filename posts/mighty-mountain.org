Mighty mountains, I dreaded its peaks and curves,
But the spirit indomitable inside, settled my nerves.
So, I climbed and climbed to the top,
leaving behind my past; I did not stop.

First came the rain, making my feet wet,
then came the sun, making my brow sweat.
I crossed a line that made the trees jealous,
Pain building in my body, but I could not care less.

My mind must make that crucial decision,
which stone to tread on next in this expedition.
For choosing the wrong step could be as fatal,
as living a life, without an adventure to tell.

Alas, I saw my yellow tent by the riverside,
On a valley alike a silver necklace on a bride.
Stretched my shape, and washed my face,
with water so cold that set my wits ablaze. 

Twilight flirted with day and night,
Sky blushed as it turned orange, bright.
Adios, I am done for the day, said the setting Sun.
'See you on the other side' was Earth's cunning pun.

The river carried mountain's letter to the sea.
The poem rhymed words of passionate love to me.
Fate, they cannot unite; divided by an invisible wall.
Faith! the mountain still awaited the next rainfall.

# The painting
Have you been waiting for something all your life?
I walked in the dark for long, forlorn, with an inner strife.
Then I stopped and looked up, now the canvas was painted black;
An imperial white moon and a thousand splendid suns smiled back.
