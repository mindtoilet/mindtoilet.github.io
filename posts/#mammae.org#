In the course of evolution, from single cell organism to fishes to amphibians to 
reptiles to birds to mammals, when was gender identified?

Let's travel back to reptiles. The early reptiles understood the need for world
sustainability by reproduction. So they happily mated and laid eggs, signed the
papers and moved on to the next honey moon. Their nonchalance was criminally
underrated. They left their eggs to sun and season to find its way to living.  A
reptile begins and ends with its own experiences. What a life!

Then came the birds. They developed feathers and wings to counter the cold.
Birds had intercourse and more eggs were delivered. They broke character and
started caring about their eggs by guarding them and keeping them warm. The
first act of true selfishness in the evolution of Evolution. A typical bird,
billions of years ago, gleefully admired its eggs at least five times a day and
religiously chanted, "Wow"

Mammals. When the world then thought hair instead of feathers is peculiarly odd
or oddly peculiar, mammals came up with the new idea of having sex and storing
eggs inside the body. Such was the shock, bird brains attained its maximum
cognisance and reptiles retired from being related. The mammalian eggs came out
alive of their body and started crying for food. The mountains and tadpoles
echoed the frequency and the first case of reptile dysfunction syndrome was
reported worldwide. Mammals then acquired the habit of providing protection and
nutrition to the offspring. Thus began the suckling and tickling.

The Mammalian care lead to association and mutual understanding. The cherishing
of the youngling created attachment, and kindled the possibility of learning by
imitation. The beginnings of true social life.  As H.G.Wells has rightly said,
"A /teachable/ type of life had come into the world". The student became the
teacher, thoughts replaced lessons, life advanced.

What about gender then? When was gender identified? All mammalian genders have
mammary glands, secreting or not. One gender refusing to mature at an early age
and another maturing at a later stage. Unravelling this bias, a primitive
hypothesis suggested that the early mammals were truly sexist and chose to suck
nipple(s) of one specific gender and disdainfully ignored the other. The
continuous process of suckling and sucking might have extended the growth of one
set and the categorical humiliation could have hindered the growth for
other. The theory also went to the extent of comparing Mammae to the ever
expanding universe. Regardless of the intellectual snobbery, this has opened up
new space of body research which the Children Of Science(CoS a.k.a Cause)
informally call as 'The shape of you'.Another question of great fiscal and
monetary importance is that since when did a set start regarding this
evolutionary augmentation as a wonder of the world and the opposite set start
wearing the inevitable as an embellishment to poverty?

The famous English thought on "To cover or not to cover" continues to baffle the
intelligent society. A thinker once said "A man goes outside and looks back to
find it sacrilegious but from inside he found it perfectly ordinary". There are
parts of the world where people are finding bliss by not covering the body or
the smile. Other parts of the world insist on covering head to toe to attain
nirvana. The rest of the world believe in heuristic principles. 

Meanwhile, The United League Of Nations(TULON), is seriously contemplating
re-introduction of /'Mulakkaram'/, loosely translated to Breast Tax, which, till
the early 20^th century, was the tax imposed on lower caste women if they wanted
to cover their breasts in public. The women were expected to pay the government
a tax on their bosom, as soon as they started developing them. The tax
collectors would visit every house to collect Boob(Either of the two fleshy
milk-secreting glandular organs on the chest of a woman) tax from any lower
caste women who passed the age of puberty. The tax was evaluated by the
collectors depending on the size of their breasts. The current generation of
people in the geographical area of 'Breast Tax' unanimously agreed ashamed of
their ancestry. An American newspaper boy casually called it as "The Cover
Charge" and the people around him laughed for seven consecutive days. Later they
were hanged, drawn and quartered for the simple crime of shamelessness.
