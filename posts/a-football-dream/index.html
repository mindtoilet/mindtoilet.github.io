Liverpool FC is my football club. Palakkad is a beautiful town in Kerala,
India. 
</p>

<p>
I have a dream…
</p>

<p>
Liverpool FC came to Palakkad to play a football game. Sadio Mane was on the
bench, but he chose to stand with the fans. While watching the game, standing
next to him was a confident young man. Naturally, they became friends.
Unforeseen, as is usually the case with nature, the game was cancelled few
minutes into the it for a reason I cannot recall.  I asked Sadio, “Will you
play football with us in my school?“ He said yes.  So I took him to Navodaya
Vidyalaya, Palakkad, the best school in the world.  I introduced Sadio to my
friends and they all were ready for a game.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>

<p>
The moment Sadio saw the ground, he fell in love with it. Western ghats in the
backdrop and the amazing Palakkadan wind made him say: “This is where I should
be playing”. Sadio played in my attack and I played in the midfield. When my
goalkeeper passed me a short ball, I looked up the field and saw Sadio making
the run. With my barefoot, I sliced the ball and it was airborne. Seconds later,
that touch by Sadio and the finish, the ball was in the back of the net.  The
trend continued, he made those runs and I sent him through on the goal. We won!
</p>


<p>
After the post match handshake and hug, Sadio asked me: “Why don’t you come to
Melwood some day?” in French obviously. I smiled, and said “Oui, I will
try. Merci beaucoup”.  Sadio flew back to England, in the plane he spoke to a
man called Jurgen Klopp. Mr. Klopp spoke to someone, and a week later I got
a call from Liverpool FC, the best football club in the world.
</p>

<p>
I landed in John Lennon airport. Imagine all the people, waiting for me.  I
reached Melwood, Liverpool FC's training ground, where my accommodation was
arranged. Sadio introduced me to his friends. Virgil was taller than me. Trent
is younger than me. Robbo warned me about Millie's humour sense. Mo's English
was better than mine. I gave Ali a chocolate and he kept it. I told Bobby he is
my favourite player. The boss gave me hug and said welcome. I knew I was home.
</p>

<p>
I wore my boots for evening's training session. Sadio told Jurgen that he wanted 
me to play in his side. I scored one, assisted two, made a goal saving tackle and
broke my ankle. Hendo lifted the ball onto Mo's path, cut it back to Bobby, he
did a no-look flick into the empty space behind Virgil. I was too quick for Big
Virgil. Blink of an eye, I slotted it past Adrian. I copied Bobby's celebration.
Allison played a simple ball to me, I looked up the field and saw Sadio making
the run. I sliced the ball and it was airborne. Seconds later, that touch by 
Sadio and the finish, the ball was in the back of the net. The second assist
followed a neat link up play between Bobby, Mo, Sadio and Me. Bobby's no look
finish met my cross at the far post. Jurgen's celebration to that was wild.
</p>

<p>
I might have kicked the wall too hard. That's how I woke up with a broken ankle,
but it was definitely worth the dream.
