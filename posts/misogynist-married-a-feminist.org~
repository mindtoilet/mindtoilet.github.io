The sky was clear and the occasion was auspicious, set to witness the unwitnessed. 

The Misogynist-Feminist wedding!

The cool breeze from the east moved her jet black hair to brush his teeth when
he was grinning. The couple stood there, facing a sea of crowd. No one was
invited to their wedding but, there was a willing crowd to witness this
fictional reality. When the news was whispered to them on a hot summer day,
hell froze over in 12.9996 seconds. Bemused, flabbergasted, thunderstruck, they
screamed in unison "What the"!


The ceremony began with frowns on faces. Some said it was a marriage made in
paradox not paradise. The couple vowed to make each other successful. 
The dessert didn't cool anybody's curiosity still, the food was good.

Was the male feminist, and misogynist female?

The Cardinals of language convened in a library. Grammar
goons waited outside. were angry at the innate irony of the scheme. Their
honor being dragged through mud. A lesson must be taught. The
infidels should be ostracized from all dictionaries.

They lived happily ever-after.
