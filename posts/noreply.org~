* Story
Day 1 : No reply.

Day 2 : No reply.

Well, what's the point of being in a messaging ecosystem if we don't yield to
its temptations? To keep the civilization going one must engage in learned
discourse, vociferous debates and rude emoticon exchange. Simply put, one must
reply to a friend's message.

Think about it this way:

Millenial Ramayanam. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakshmana][Lakshmanan]] on his death bed. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rama][Raman]] pings [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman][Hanuman]] : "Bro,
ngl, Lak is fried... bad scene... URGENT!... need Sanjeevani ASAP!!!"

Assume a scenario where Hanuman ignored the text. Now, Gen-Y Raman will not
make a call to Hanuman to assert the gravity of the situation, because it simply
ain't cool to call. Couple of days later
Hanuman reaches the base camp, smoking chillum, lit af, and through the chillum
smoke he sees another huge smoke in front of him; realises it is coming from
Lakshmanan's funeral pyre, and goes WTAF !!! Raman has one less thing to worry
about, and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugriva][Sugreevan]] would be still plucking Tulsi leaves one at a time in
Himalayan valley, thinking it must be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjeevani_(plant)][Sanjeevani]], going by its smell.

What a fate!!!

Well, luckily, Hanuman, my hero, your hero, every man's hero, didn't do such a
thing. He immediately replied to Raman: "Coolio", and brought the entire
mountain, and the episode ended with a close-up shot of Lakshmanan eating
protein bars and Greek salad on his recovery path to full fitness. Sugreevan is
smoking chillum in the background.

So my dear friends, moral of the story is that one must reply to their friend's
messages at the earliest.

Jai Hanuman. Many peace.
