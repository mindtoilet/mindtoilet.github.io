What happened?
I don't know sir. I was reading a book and suddenly heard a loud noise outside.

Can you elaborate on what happened yesterday?
That's what sir, I was reading a book and suddenly bang.

Can you please try to recreate your evening till the incident?
Yes sir. I came late from work and after reaching home, I still had to attend
two meetings sir. Luckily, both meetings got cancelled. It was a moment of
synchronization sir, Unbelievable. Now, I can peacefully practice music.

What time was this?
20:20 sir.

Okay, what happened after that?
I practised for 1 hour sir. I was good, really good work out for my body and by
the time I finished I was sweating and trembling top to bottom. I wrapped things
up and came back hungry looking for something and found a banana in my study
table. I remember keeping that banana there early sir. Usually I don't keep
banana like that. It was another moment of synchronization sir. Unbelievable.

Alright, then what?
