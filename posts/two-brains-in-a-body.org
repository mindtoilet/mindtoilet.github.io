The two-brain theory is too hard to understand with one brain.

To the many advantages of having two brains in a body. 
One brain can watch television other can do homework.
You can eat appetizer and dessert at the same time.
Sing one song while listening to another.


Where would you keep the second brain? My friend was eager to suggest
buttocks. Nah! aren't we trying to make things even?
I will keep my second brain in my stomach. People can't call me fat anymore.
Flat stomachs will be called morons.
