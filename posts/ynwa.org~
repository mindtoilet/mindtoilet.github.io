I found this poem inside the perfect gift for a lifelong Liverpool F.C fan.  My
friend Harish, a proud Chelsea F.C fan wrote this poem. Harish understands
football better than anyone else. Football is happiness and sorrow, triumphs and
heartbreaks. It is freedom. It is love. It is a religion without hatred. We all
love the game and the game loves us back.

Do you remember? Is it a blur? Reminisce,
As you sailed through the highs and the lows,
Through the soaring peaks and the infinte abyss,
Darkness, the roll of a dice, chaos, the fall of a domino.

The words of a special anthem echoes
Softly, just like it did in Turkey and Madrid
A wave of red, devoured the green meadows
Millions of souls dreamt, breathless, achieve it they did!

That echo is now a roar, your ears hurt
Do not resist, for it is a beacon of hope
Pull up your socks, be ready and be alert
For even in the face of defeat, you will kop(e)

The walk is now a jog, the road to salvation
The time to show how much you've grown
A fallen fear, broken heart, a whisper, o realisation
For even in lucid dreams, you'll never walk alone.

YNWA!
