&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What happened?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was reading a book, and suddenly heard a loud noise from outside.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you please elaborate?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's what sir BANG!, and seconds later, a second BANG.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you try to recreate your evening till the incident?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes sir.&lt;br&gt;
Yesterday, I came back late from work. I had to attend two more meetings&lt;br&gt;
after that sir. "Mrs. Elusive Luck's birthday, my god", both meetings&lt;br&gt;
got cancelled. I was happy to do my homework from morning's music class.&lt;br&gt;
I practised music for an hour or, maybe little more sir. It was a good&lt;br&gt;
workout, and by the end, I was sweating, and trembling from top to bottom.&lt;br&gt;
I wrapped the scene, and was hungrily wandering inside, and I found a&lt;br&gt;
banana on my study table. Who keeps a banana on study table sir?&lt;br&gt;
Well, I did, yesterday morning. Sync sir, Unbelievable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alright, then what?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Thought of cooking dinner sir. Dosa in my mind, I found couple of duck eggs in&lt;br&gt;
the fridge. 'Egg Dosa' creeped, sorry crept into my head. I brought Dosa batter,&lt;br&gt;
and eggs outside to warmth. Roasted some curry leaves sir, and ground them with&lt;br&gt;
chillies to a green paste. Fried some Coin Pappads as well.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An eerie silence lurked in the kitchen while I was chopping onions. I added salt,&lt;br&gt;
and a pinch of turmeric to the onions, whereupon I introduced our dear eggs to&lt;br&gt;
Madame la Guillotine, CRACK!, its viscous yellow head slipped in to the bowl.&lt;br&gt;
I stirred a motley mixture after that. When the pan on the stove started&lt;br&gt;
whispering to wind, I threw a water blanket over it, to which, it hissed,&lt;br&gt;
and shot sodium-in-water kind of tantrums at me. I calmly slid its burning bubbles&lt;br&gt;
to the sink. Then, I painted a solar system on the pan with the batter. The&lt;br&gt;
system needed to be perfect. A subtle press in the center was by followed by&lt;br&gt;
concentric Sufi whirling. It must spread into a round Gaussian distribution,&lt;br&gt;
and scatter a Brownian motion of batter pores. The pores would channel the steam&lt;br&gt;
upwards, cooking the layers above it, along its itinerary. Then I sprayed oil,&lt;br&gt;
and smeared the roasted curry chilli green paste over the Dosa. Few seconds&lt;br&gt;
later, I massaged the duck egg mash on the green pasture.&lt;br&gt;
Juxtaposition, hitherto unrealistic, was accomplished.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sir, then I flipped the Dosa, and waited for some time, for the other side to get&lt;br&gt;
cooked, and kept the Dosa aside. Made one more Dosa like that sir. I ate both&lt;br&gt;
Dosas with Maple syrup, Chammanthi Podi, and Coin pappads sir.&lt;br&gt;
Sync sir, Unbelievable.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is a Chammanthi podi?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sir, this is not the appropriate time sir. Maybe later.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had a Pear, drank 350ml water, brushed my teeth, wrote a blog post, washed&lt;br&gt;
my legs, and went to bed. I continued reading the book "To kill a mockingbird",&lt;br&gt;
when suddenly heard a loud noise from outside sir.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is that it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yes sir.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Well, write down your address and phone number. You will have to come to the&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;police station when called upon, to give your statement about yesterday's&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;incident.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sure sir. Done deal.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The Director is waiting in the car.&lt;br&gt;
Assistant enters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A: Stanley, they are not laughing.&lt;br&gt;
S: What do you mean they aren't laughing?&lt;br&gt;
S: Did you hear them not laughing? It is a comedy movie.&lt;br&gt;
A: I know sir. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.&lt;br&gt;
S: Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.&lt;br&gt;
A: They are just silent sir. There is a powerful sound vacuum.&lt;br&gt;
S: But, I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?&lt;br&gt;
A: Yes sir, it did tickle me.&lt;br&gt;
S: The actors also were hysterical during the filming.&lt;br&gt;
S: They had time of their life doing what I told them to do.&lt;br&gt;
A: Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.&lt;br&gt;
S: Why are the audience such cretins?&lt;br&gt;
A: I don't know sir. But some of them even left in between the show.&lt;br&gt;
S: That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!&lt;br&gt;
A: I couldn't take it as well sir. That's why I came out to tell you.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thanks Amy. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?&lt;br&gt;
A: I think he inside the hall watching the movie.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.&lt;br&gt;
A: Sir, here he comes. In his face, I see, Sir … Satisfaction!!!&lt;br&gt;
S: Wonderful, Wonderful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Driver enters…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
S: David, Did you enjoy it?&lt;br&gt;
A: Tell us, how was it?&lt;br&gt;
D: It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thank God. All that not in vain.&lt;br&gt;
A: Is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
D: Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.&lt;br&gt;
S: Were you not in the theater?&lt;br&gt;
A: Watching the movie?&lt;br&gt;
D: Oh, no.. no.. I was in the toilet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt; I sit?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Sure.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; This is good.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Is that water?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Yes.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; I'm from the future.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Right.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Your people visit a lot these days. Are you a tourist?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No, I am a Zogerlog.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; New kind?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No, one of the oldest.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Is it true that future is not time bound?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Future is place.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Well present is time.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; So what brings you here?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Sex.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Does sex has a different meaning in future?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Sex is void in future.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Right. What kind of sex?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Find out. Suggestions?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Go by the books.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No good. Confuse.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Really? When did you land?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; land?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; When did you try sex?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Tomorrow&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; You mean yesterday.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No, tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Alright. What happened?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; The power go off. Internet loss.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; So?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Stream interrupt at 78.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Interesting. Why didn't you download it upfront ?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Space waste.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Did you finish it then?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No. Reschedule. Suggestions?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Well, how can I send you a link? Do you have a cell phone?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No cell phone. If you browse, I copy history.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Copy. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Wait. Not that.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Copy.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Not that either.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; That?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; That.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Copy. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Peace.&lt;br&gt;
