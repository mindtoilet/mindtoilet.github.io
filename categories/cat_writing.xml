&lt;p&gt;
The Director is waiting in the car.&lt;br&gt;
Assistant enters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A: Stanley, they are not laughing.&lt;br&gt;
S: What do you mean they aren't laughing?&lt;br&gt;
S: Did you hear them not laughing?  It is a comedy movie.&lt;br&gt;
A: I know sir. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.&lt;br&gt;
S: Ridiculous, ridiculous.&lt;br&gt;
S: The script was hilarious. I wrote it.&lt;br&gt;
A: They are just silent sir. There is a powerful sound vacuum.&lt;br&gt;
S: But, I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?&lt;br&gt;
A: Yes sir, it did tickle me.&lt;br&gt;
S: The actors also were hysteric during the filming.&lt;br&gt;
S: They had time of their life doing what I told them to do.&lt;br&gt;
A: Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.&lt;br&gt;
S: Why are the audience such cretins?&lt;br&gt;
A: I don't know sir. But some of them even left in between the show.&lt;br&gt;
S: That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!&lt;br&gt;
A: I couldn't take it as well sir. That's why I came out to tell you.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thanks Amy.&lt;br&gt;
S: Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?&lt;br&gt;
A: I think he inside the hall watching the movie.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.&lt;br&gt;
A: Sir, here he comes. In his face, I see, Sir… Satisfaction!!!&lt;br&gt;
S: Wonderful, Wonderful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Driver enters…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
S: David, Did you enjoy it?&lt;br&gt;
A: Tell us, how was it?&lt;br&gt;
D: It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thank God. All that not in vain.&lt;br&gt;
A: Is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
D: Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.&lt;br&gt;
S: Were you not in the theater?&lt;br&gt;
A: Watching the movie?&lt;br&gt;
D: Oh, no.. no.. I was in the toilet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt; I sit?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Sure.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; This is good.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Is that water?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Yes.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; I'm from the future.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Right.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Your people visit a lot these days. Are you a tourist?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No, I am a Zogerlog.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; New kind?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No, one of the oldest.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Is it true that future is not time bound?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Future is place.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Well present is time.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; So what brings you here?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Sex.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Does sex has a different meaning in future?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Sex is void in future.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Right. What kind of sex?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Find out. Suggestions?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Go by the books.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No good. Confuse.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Really? When did you land?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; land?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; When did you try sex?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Tomorrow&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; You mean yesterday.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No, tomorrow.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Alright. What happened?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; The power go off. Internet loss.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; So?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Stream interrupt at 78.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Interesting. Why didn't you download it upfront ?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Space waste.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Did you finish it then?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No. Reschedule. Suggestions?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Well, how can I send you a link? Do you have a cell phone?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; No cell phone. If you browse, I copy history.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Copy. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Wait. Not that.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Copy.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Not that either.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; That?&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; That.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;gt; Copy. Thanks.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;lt; Peace.&lt;br&gt;
