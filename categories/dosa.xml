&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What happened?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I was reading a book, and suddenly heard a loud noise from outside.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can you please elaborate?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
That's what sir, BANG!, and seconds later, a second BANG.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Will you be able to recreate your evening till the incident?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, sir. Yesterday I came back late from work, to attend two more late evening
meetings. Ms. Elusive Luck's birthday, &lt;b&gt;my god&lt;/b&gt;, both meetings got cancelled 
at my arrival. So, I practised music for what I thought was an hour.
Sir, It was a good workout, and by the end I was sweating and shivering
from forehead to heels. I wrapped the set, and was hungrily wandering indoors.
That's when i saw the most beautiful thing on my study table. A banana!
Who keeps a banana on a study table, sir? Well, I did, yesterday morning. 
Sync sir, Unbelievable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alright, then what?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sir, i thought of cooking dinner. Dosa in my mind, I found couple of duck eggs
in the fridge. 'Egg Dosa' creeped, sorry, crept into my head. I fetched Dosa
batter and eggs to the warmth outside. Roasted some curry leaves, and ground
them with chillies into a lush green paste. Fried some Coin Pappads as well.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
An eerie silence lurked in the kitchen while I was chopping onions. I added
salt, and a pinch of turmeric to the onions. Then I introduced our dear eggs
to Madame la Guillotine, CRACK!, its viscous yellow head crashed into the bowl.
I stirred a motley mixture with all that. When the pan on the stove, started
whispering to the winds, i threw a water blanket over it. The pan hissed, 
and shot sodium-in-water sorta tantrums at me. I calmly slid the hot bubbling
bubbles into the sink. Then, I painted a solar system on the pan with batter.
The system had to be perfect. A subtle press in the center was by followed by
concentric Sufi whirling. It must spread into a round Gaussian distribution,
and scatter a Brownian motion of batter pores. The pores would channel the 
steam upwards, cooking the layers above en route its itinerary. Then, i
sprayed oil, and smeared the lush green paste on top of the maturing Dosa.
Few seconds later, I massaged the duck egg mash on the green pasture.
Juxtaposition, hitherto unrealistic, was accomplished.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Sir, I flipped the Dosa, and waited for the other side to get cooked, flipped it
again, and kept the Dosa aside. Made one more Dosa like that, sir. Later, I ate
both Dosas with Maple syrup, Chammanthi Podi, and Coin pappads sir.  
Sync sir, Unbelievable.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is a Chammanthi podi?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Sir, this ain't the appropriate time sir. Maybe later.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Then?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I had a pear, drank 350ml of water, brushed my teeth, wrote a blog post, washed
my legs, and went to bed. I continued reading the book "To kill a mockingbird",
when suddenly heard a loud noise from outside sir.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Is that it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
Yes sir.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Well, write down your address and phone number. You will have to come to the&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;police station when called upon, to give your statement about yesterday's&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;incident.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Done deal, sir. Many peace.
&lt;/p&gt;
