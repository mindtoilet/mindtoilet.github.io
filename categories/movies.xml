&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;FIRST ACT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		    SCENE&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Inside the car parked outside the movie theatre.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[The Director is waiting inside the car.]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[Enter Mrs. Annamma]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
ANNAMMA: Earnest, my dear, they are not laughing.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: What do you mean they aren't laughing? Did you hear them not laughing?&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: Yes.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: It is a comedy movie.&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: I know. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: They are just silent. There is a powerful sound vacuum.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: That's impossible. I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: Yes. It did tickle me.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: The actors also were hysterical during the filming. They had the time of their life doing what I told them to do.&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Why are the audience such cretins?&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: I don't know. But some of them even left the theatre in between the show.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: I couldn't take it as well. That's why I came out to tell you.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Thanks Annamma. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: I think he inside the hall watching the movie.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: Here he comes. In his face, I see… satisfaction!&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Wonderful, Wonderful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;SECOND ACT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		    SCENE&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Outside the car parked outside the movie theatre.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[The Director and Assistant gets out of the car.]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[Enter Partha]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
EARNEST: Partha, Did you enjoy it?&lt;br&gt;
PARTHAA: Sir, it is Parthaa, not Partha.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Parthaa, Did you enjoy it?&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: Tell us, how was it?&lt;br&gt;
PARTHAA: It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Thank God. All that not in vain.&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: Well done Earnest. Congratulations.&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Thanks dear.&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: Parthaa, is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
PARTHAA: Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: (exchanging look with Earnest) You finished it quickly…?&lt;br&gt;
EARNEST: Were you not in the theatre?&lt;br&gt;
ANNAMMA: Watching the movie?&lt;br&gt;
PARTHAA: Oh, no.. no.. I was in the toilet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
