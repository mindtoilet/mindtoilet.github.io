I read about hypocognition recently in an &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/ideas/hypocognition-is-a-censorship-tool-that-mutes-what-we-can-feel"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; shared by my friend. It is a
state, where a feeling, a concept, or a phenomenon cannot be put into words.
For example, what's the word for &lt;i&gt;the vague uncomfortable feeling of sitting on
a seat that is still radiating warmth from someone else’s bottom&lt;/i&gt;? It is called
&lt;i&gt;Shoeburyness&lt;/i&gt;. I had such an experience, not shoeburyness, that, I have had in
many a wonderful occasions. Hypocognition happened.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
I think, therefore I am sometimes able to enjoy certain moments of exquisite
intellectual pleasure of knowing that a completely unknown person in the world,
dead or alive, has resonated with your thoughts. Once, I was in a bed and I
thought: "There are certain things in the world which will not bend to
force. Things, that cannot be acquired by power, but are presented by faith and
happiness. &lt;b&gt;Love!&lt;/b&gt; I strongly believe that love is for those who deserve it. The
wealthiest human cannot find an ounce of love any of the shops in the world. The
strongest human can never feel love through arm wrestling. Love cannot be
snatched, bought or bartered. That's where the satisfaction of giving is
born. If you can, ask a dog about it."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Books are wonderful objects. My friend might think me queer to call it an
object. People think books have feelings. I too have thought so. Currently, I am
reading Siddhartha by Herman Hesse. Today, I read this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Siddhartha&lt;/b&gt; : "Oh, he's strong, the Samana, and he isn't afraid of anything. He
could force you, beautiful girl. He could kidnap you. He could hurt you."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Kamala&lt;/b&gt; : "No, Samana, I am not afraid of this. Did any Samana or Brahman ever
fear, someone might come and grab him and steal his learning, and his religious
devotion, and his depth of thought? No, for they are his very own, and he would
only give away from those whatever he is willing to give and to whomever he is
willing to give. Like this it is, precisely like this it is also with Kamala and
with pleasures o love. Beautiful and red is Kamala's mouth, but just try to kiss
it against Kamala's will, and you will not obtain a single drop of sweetness
from it, which knows how to give so many sweet things! You are learning easily,
Siddhartha, thus you should also learn this: love can be obtained by begging,
buying, receiving it as a gift, finding it in the street, but it cannot be
stolen. In this, you have come up with the wrong path. No, it would be a pity,
if a pretty young man like you would want to tackle it in such a wrong manner."
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Resonating thoughts!
