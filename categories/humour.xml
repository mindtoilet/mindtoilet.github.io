&lt;p&gt;
The Director is waiting in the car.&lt;br&gt;
Assistant enters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Stanley, they are not laughing.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: What do you mean they aren't laughing?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Did you hear them not laughing? It is a comedy movie.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: I know sir. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: They are just silent sir. There is a powerful sound vacuum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: But, I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Yes sir, it did tickle me.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: The actors also were hysterical during the filming.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: They had time of their life doing what I told them to do.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Why are the audience such cretins?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: I don't know sir. But some of them even left in between the show.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: I couldn't take it as well sir. That's why I came out to tell you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Thanks Amy. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: I think he inside the hall watching the movie.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Sir, here he comes. In his face, I see, Sir … Satisfaction!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Wonderful, Wonderful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Driver enters…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: David, Did you enjoy it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Tell us, how was it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;: It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Thank God. All that not in vain.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;: Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;: Were you not in the theater?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;: Watching the movie?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;: Oh, no.. no.. I was in the toilet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
