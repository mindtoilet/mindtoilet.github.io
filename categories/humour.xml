&lt;p&gt;
The Director is waiting in the car.&lt;br&gt;
Assistant enters.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
A: Stanley, they are not laughing.&lt;br&gt;
S: What do you mean they aren't laughing?&lt;br&gt;
S: Did you hear them not laughing? It is a comedy movie.&lt;br&gt;
A: I know sir. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.&lt;br&gt;
S: Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.&lt;br&gt;
A: They are just silent sir. There is a powerful sound vacuum.&lt;br&gt;
S: But, I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?&lt;br&gt;
A: Yes sir, it did tickle me.&lt;br&gt;
S: The actors also were hysterical during the filming.&lt;br&gt;
S: They had time of their life doing what I told them to do.&lt;br&gt;
A: Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.&lt;br&gt;
S: Why are the audience such cretins?&lt;br&gt;
A: I don't know sir. But some of them even left in between the show.&lt;br&gt;
S: That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!&lt;br&gt;
A: I couldn't take it as well sir. That's why I came out to tell you.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thanks Amy. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?&lt;br&gt;
A: I think he inside the hall watching the movie.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.&lt;br&gt;
A: Sir, here he comes. In his face, I see, Sir … Satisfaction!!!&lt;br&gt;
S: Wonderful, Wonderful!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Driver enters…&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
S: David, Did you enjoy it?&lt;br&gt;
A: Tell us, how was it?&lt;br&gt;
D: It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.&lt;br&gt;
S: Thank God. All that not in vain.&lt;br&gt;
A: Is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
D: Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.&lt;br&gt;
S: Were you not in the theater?&lt;br&gt;
A: Watching the movie?&lt;br&gt;
D: Oh, no.. no.. I was in the toilet.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
