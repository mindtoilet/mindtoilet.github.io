<p>
Liverpool FC is my football club. Palakkad is a beautiful town in Kerala,
India. 
</p>

<p>
I have a dream…
</p>

<p>
Liverpool FC came to Palakkad to play a football game. Sadio Mane was on the
bench, but he chose to stand with the fans. While watching the game, standing
next to him was a confident young man. Naturally, they became friends.
Unforeseen, as is usually the case with nature, the game was cancelled few
minutes into the it for a reason I cannot recall.  I asked Sadio, “Will you
play football with us in my school?“ He said yes.  So I took him to Navodaya
Vidyalaya, Palakkad, the best school in the world.  I introduced Sadio to my
friends and they all were ready for a game.<br></p>

<hr>
<p>
<img src="galleries/NavodayaGround.JPG" alt="nil"></p>
<hr>
<p>
The moment Sadio saw the ground, he fell in love with it. Western ghats in the
backdrop and the amazing Palakkadan wind made him say: “This is where I should
be playing”. Sadio played in my attack and I played in the midfield. When my
goalkeeper passed me a short ball, I looked up the field and saw Sadio making
the run. With my barefoot, I sliced the ball and it was airborne. Seconds later,
that touch by Sadio and the finish, the ball was in the back of the net.  The
trend continued, he made those runs and I sent him through on the goal. We won!
</p>


<p>
After the post match handshake and hug, Sadio asked me: “Why don’t you come to
Melwood some day?” in French obviously. I smiled, and said “Oui, I will
try. Merci beaucoup”.  Sadio flew back to England, in the plane he spoke to a
man called Jurgen Klopp. Mr. Klopp spoke to someone, and a week later I got
a call from Liverpool FC, the best football club in the world.
</p>

<p>
I landed in John Lennon airport. Imagine all the people, waiting for me.  I
reached Melwood, Liverpool FC's training ground, where my accommodation was
arranged. Sadio introduced me to his friends. Virgil was taller than me. Trent
is younger than me. Robbo warned me about Millie's humour sense. Mo's English
was better than mine. I gave Ali a chocolate and he kept it. I told Bobby he is
my favourite player. The boss gave me hug and said welcome. I knew I was home.
</p>

<p>
I wore my boots for evening's training session. Sadio told Jurgen that he wanted 
me to play in his side. I scored one, assisted two, made a goal saving tackle and
broke my ankle. Hendo lifted the ball onto Mo's path, cut it back to Bobby, he
did a no-look flick into the empty space behind Virgil. I was too quick for Big
Virgil. Blink of an eye, I slotted it past Adrian. I copied Bobby's celebration.
Allison played a simple ball to me, I looked up the field and saw Sadio making
the run. I sliced the ball and it was airborne. Seconds later, that touch by 
Sadio and the finish, the ball was in the back of the net. The second assist
followed a neat link up play between Bobby, Mo, Sadio and Me. Bobby's no look
finish met my cross at the far post. Jurgen's celebration to that was wild.
</p>

<p>
I might have kicked the wall too hard. That's how I woke up with a broken ankle,
but it was definitely worth the dream. 
</p>


<p>
YWNA!

<hr>
<p>
Mighty mountains, I dreaded its peaks and curves,<br>
But the spirit indomitable inside, settled my nerves.<br>
So, I climbed and climbed to the top,<br>
leaving behind my past; I did not stop.<br></p>

<p>
First came the rain, making my feet wet,<br>
then came the sun, making my brow sweat.<br>
I crossed a line that made the trees jealous,<br>
Pain building in my body, but I could not care less.<br></p>

<p>
My mind must make that crucial decision,<br>
which stone to tread on next in this expedition.<br>
For choosing the wrong step could be as fatal,<br>
as living a life, without an adventure to tell.<br></p>

<p>
Alas, I saw my yellow tent by the riverside,<br>
On a valley alike a silver necklace on a bride.<br>
Stretched my shape, and washed my face,<br>
with water so cold that set my wits ablaze.<br></p>

<p>
Twilight flirted with day and night,<br>
Sky blushed as it turned orange, bright.<br>
Adios, I am done for the day, said the setting Sun.<br>
'See you on the other side' was Earth's cunning pun.<br></p>

<p>
The river carried mountain's letter to the sea.<br>
The poem rhymed words of passionate love to me.<br>
Fate, they cannot unite; divided by an invisible wall.<br>
Faith! the mountain still awaited the next rainfall.<br></p>

<p>
Have you been waiting for something all your life?<br>
I walked in the dark for long, forlorn, with an inner strife.<br>
Then I stopped and looked up, now the canvas was painted black;<br>
An imperial white moon and a thousand splendid suns smiled back.<br></p>

<b><i>What happened?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
I was reading a book, and suddenly heard a loud noise from outside.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Can you please elaborate?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
That's what sir, BANG!, and seconds later, a second BANG.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Will you be able to recreate your evening till the incident?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
Yes, sir. Yesterday I came back late from work, to attend two more late evening<br>
meetings. Ms. Elusive Luck's birthday, <b>my god</b>, both meetings got cancelled<br>
at my arrival. So, I practised music for what I thought was an hour.<br>
Sir, It was a good workout, and by the end I was sweating and shivering<br>
from forehead to heels. I wrapped the set, and was hungrily wandering indoors.<br>
That's when i saw the most beautiful thing on my study table. A banana!<br>
Who keeps a banana on a study table, sir? Well, I did, yesterday morning.<br>
Sync sir, Unbelievable.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Alright, then what?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
Sir, i thought of cooking dinner. Dosa in my mind, I found couple of duck eggs<br>
in the fridge. 'Egg Dosa' creeped, sorry, crept into my head. I fetched Dosa<br>
batter and eggs to the warmth outside. Roasted some curry leaves, and ground<br>
them with chillies into a lush green paste. Fried some Coin Pappads as well.<br></p>

<p>
An eerie silence lurked in the kitchen while I was chopping onions. I added<br>
salt, and a pinch of turmeric to the onions. Then I introduced our dear eggs<br>
to Madame la Guillotine, CRACK!, its viscous yellow head crashed into the bowl.<br>
I stirred a motley mixture with all that. When the pan on the stove, started<br>
whispering to the winds, i threw a water blanket over it. The pan hissed,<br>
and shot sodium-in-water sorta tantrums at me. I calmly slid the hot bubbling<br>
bubbles into the sink. Then, I painted a solar system on the pan with batter.<br>
The system had to be perfect. A subtle press in the center was by followed by<br>
concentric Sufi whirling. It must spread into a round Gaussian distribution,<br>
and scatter a Brownian motion of batter pores. The pores would channel the<br>
steam upwards, cooking the layers above en route its itinerary. Then, i<br>
sprayed oil, and smeared the lush green paste on top of the maturing Dosa.<br>
Few seconds later, I massaged the duck egg mash on the green pasture.<br>
Juxtaposition, hitherto unrealistic, was accomplished.<br></p>

<p>
Sir, I flipped the Dosa, and waited for the other side to get cooked, flipped it<br>
again, and kept the Dosa aside. Made one more Dosa like that, sir. Later, I ate<br>
both Dosas with Maple syrup, Chammanthi Podi, and Coin pappads sir.<br>
Sync sir, Unbelievable.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>What is a Chammanthi podi?</i></b><br>
Sir, this ain't the appropriate time sir. Maybe later.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Then?</i></b><br></p>

<p>
I had a pear, drank 350ml of water, brushed my teeth, wrote a blog post, washed<br>
my legs, and went to bed. I continued reading the book "To kill a mockingbird",<br>
when suddenly heard a loud noise from outside sir.<br></p>

<p>
<b><i>Is that it?</i></b><br>
Yes sir.<br></p>

<p>
<i>Well, write down your address and phone number. You will have to come to the</i><br><i>police station when called upon, to give your statement about yesterday's</i><br><i>incident.</i><br></p>

<p>
Done deal, sir. Many peace.<br></p>

<p>
The sky was clear and the occasion was auspicious, all set to witness the unwitnessed.<br></p>

<p>
<i>The Misogynist-Feminist wedding!</i><br></p>

<p>
The cool breeze from the east moved her jet black hair to his teeth.<br>
He stopped grinning at once.<br>
No one was invited to their wedding, but they were facing a sea of<br>
willing crowd to this fictional reality. When the news was whispered<br>
to them on a hot summer day, they were all <i>thunderstruck</i>,<br>
and screamed in unison, "What the"!<br></p>

<p>
The ceremony began with frowns. The crowd murmured incessantly.<br>
They argued the male was feminist, and misogynist female;<br>
said it was a marriage made in paradox not paradise.<br>
When the couple vowed to make each other successful,<br>
old women in the crowd lifted their hands to mouth in pure shock.<br>
Maybe, the crowd was not ready for this, it was way ahead of their time.<br></p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the <i>Cardinals of language</i> convened in a brand new library.<br><i>Grammar goons</i> waited outside with Safety pins and Clown hats.<br>
They were angry at the innate irony of the scheme, thought it to be a joke;<br>
their honor and semantics being dragged through mud. A lesson must be taught.<br>
The infidels should be ostracized from dictionaries at the least. At last,<br>
the convention decided to punish them with the <i>punishment-that-shall-never-be-given</i>.<br></p>

<p>
A huge drama followed, and the couple lived happily ever-after.<br></p>

A: Stanley, they are not laughing.<br>
S: What do you mean they aren't laughing?<br>
S: Did you hear them not laughing? It is a comedy movie.<br>
A: I know sir. But there is no laughter. Humour is hiding.<br>
S: Ridiculous, ridiculous. The script was hilarious. I wrote it.<br>
A: They are just silent sir. There is a powerful sound vacuum.<br>
S: But, I remember it was funny. Didn't it tickle your funny bone?<br>
A: Yes sir, it did tickle me.<br>
S: The actors also were hysterical during the filming.<br>
S: They had time of their life doing what I told them to do.<br>
A: Right Sir. They did laugh their bottoms up.<br>
S: Why are the audience such cretins?<br>
A: I don't know sir. But some of them even left in between the show.<br>
S: That's cold blooded comedy blasphemy!<br>
A: I couldn't take it as well sir. That's why I came out to tell you.<br>
S: Thanks Amy. Let's get out of here. Where is our driver?<br>
A: I think he inside the hall watching the movie.<br>
S: Thank goodness, at least the boy has some sense of humour.<br>
A: Sir, here he comes. In his face, I see, Sir … Satisfaction!!!<br>

A: Tell us, how was it?<br>
D: It was relaxing. Thanks for asking.<br>
S: Thank God. All that not in vain.<br>
A: Is it over already? I thought it went for another 30 minutes.<br>
D: Sorry what? No, I finished it quickly.<br>
S: Were you not in the theater?<br>
A: Watching the movie?<br>

<h2 id="sec-3"><code>Well</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The idea is to create a blogging website hosted in <i>Github</i>, using a
static site generator software <i>Nikola</i>, with the help of <i>Python
virtual environment</i> and then write blog posts using <i>emacs org mode</i>.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-3-0-1" class="outline-4">

<p>
So, keeping that in mind:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create a GitHub account with username 'bottle'
</li>
<li>Create a repository with the following name:'bottle.github.io'
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">Instructions</a>.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Once done this, GitHub will host your website in the following
address(URL) : <a href="https://bottle.github.io/">https://bottle.github.io/</a>
</p>

<p>
Clone(copy) this newborn repository into your local machine a.k.a
personal computer by using the following command:
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone https://bottle.github.io/ <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/projects/bottle
</pre></div>

<p>
You will be adding blog posts in ~/projects/bottle directory and will
push them back to GitHub later.

<h2 id="sec-5"><code>Python Virtual Environment</code></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
If you haven't heard the news yet, Python is a programming
language and Python 3 is here to stay.
</p>

<p>
Python Virtual environment basically copies python scripts to create a
new workplace. You could install custom python packages specific to your
project. This means packages used for one project will not pollute
another project.
</p>

<p>
For e.g. if you wish to have a separate working environment for
cooking vegetables, where you don't want nikola to be installed, 
create a virtual environment called vegetables. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-1">Virtual environment wrapper</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Gift-wrapped python virtual environment commands.
For ease of use. No need to remember too many virtualenv commands.
</p>


<p>
Let "$HOME/virenvs" be our directory for all environments.

<code>As always, names doesn't matter. It is what you do that defines you - Spiderman's ex-girlfriend</code>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-sec-5-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5-2">Steps</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
Make sure you have pip (python package manager) installed in your machine.
And follow the steps :
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">WORKON_HOME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$HOME</span>/virenvs

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola init bottle
</pre></div>
<p>
Fill in the form that follows.
</p>

<p>
It should show a success message after form is filled.
Now, nikola will create a new folder called bottle inside
<code>$HOME/projects/bottle</code>, which is unnecessary. So move its contents to
<code>$HOME/projects/bottle</code> folder and delete the extra bottle.
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mv my_first_site/* .
rm -r my_first_site
</pre></div>


<p>
Your new site 'bottle' can be viewed either locally or globally(using
a new technology called internet). The latter will be done later.
</p>

<p>
To view your recently created site locally, 
</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>nikola build
nikola serve
</pre></div>

<p>
Open browser and enter <i>localhost:8000</i> in the URL bar !
